## thoughts
This truss would use string under the main plane of the structure to transfer the loads
The different iterations of the design show changes of the orientation of the supports to minimise weight and increase rigidity

the different iterations of the drawings are all the same idea, just changing around where the angled supports are. Landing gear could be added as shown in the sketch next to the calculations

the maximum acceleration is not accurate, with a mass of 0.6kg the max acceleration is just over 2g

### pros
**looks cool**
string will probably be lighter than wood while transferring the same tensile load

### cons
will be weak in torsion
tensioning the strings properly could be hard

on the right is a basic truss that is cut from a single piece of wood. The triangular cut outs will hopefully minimise weight while keeping most of the integrity of the wood. The corners have large radii to minimise the stress concentration.
Ideally this truss will be easy to extend to any length.

On the left is the layout of the quadcopter. The motors are obviously on long booms as is required. The squares in the middle are so that they can all be mounted and they have minimal degrees of freedom. 
Depending on how it is designed, the small square in the middle could be used to mount the battery

the cross hatched square would be the plate to mount everything on. It would have a lot of holes to minimise weight

calculations are nothing important

### pros
The truss will be a lot more simple than tensioning the string and should still be quite strong

The layout should give good mounting space while still keeping everything constrained
should be easy to model

### cons
may have to make the truss quite wide at the edges to avoid stress concentrations
may not be that much better in torsion

might be difficult to mount anything on top

## thoughts
basic T-beam made of wood, fixed together with glue. this should give a good second moment of area as well as plenty of area for mounting ESCs, other hardware and any potential sensors for a unique selling point.

the bottom drawings are ideas for how to mount the motor arms to the main plate. For extra rigidity, it could slot into the area between the horizontal and vertical bits of the beam

### pros
very rigid
could decrease the amount of material in either part of the beam to reduce weight
vertical bits of T-beam could act as landing gear?
plenty of mounting area

# general thoughts
will have to be careful about the direction of cutting the wood, as it may be quite anisotropic. 
[little page on plywood construction](https://technologystudent.com/joints/plywood1.html)

may be worth mounting the motors onto rubber or something to damp out the vibrations so it doesn't affect other stuff 

stuff should be mounted along the axes of the flight controller to minimise the products of inertia
